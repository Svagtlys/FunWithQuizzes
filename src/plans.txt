First, the questions. We want to be able to handle multiple types of questions:

Multiple choice: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which only one may be chosen and only one answer is correct
Checkbox: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which any number may be chosen; there is one correct combination of choices
True/False: a question that has a true/false answer

What do these types of questions have in common?
    The question
    The options
    The correct answer (array, all in array must be chosen to be correct, is usually array size 1)
    The user's answer (array, is usually max array size 1)
What makes these question types different?
    Multiple Choice
        CorrectAnswer array size 1
        UserAnswer array size 1

    Checkbox
        CorrectAnswer array size greater than 1
        UserAnswer array size equal to CorrectAnswer array size, but will accept less (less will be graded as incorrect)

    True/False (can extend multiple choice)
        Options are fixed (True, False)
        CorrectAnswer array size 1
        UserAnswer array size 1

abstract Question{
    protected String question
    protected String[] options
    protected String[] correctAnswer
    protected String[] userAnswer

    Question(String question, String[] options, String[] correctAnswer){
        this.question = question;
        this.options = options;
        this.correctAnswer = correctAnswer;
        this.userAnswer = new String[correctAnswer.length];
    }

    public String checkAnswer(){
        //compare correctAnswer and userAnswer: if lengths differ, incorrect. if answers different, incorrect
        //(len > 1, userAnswer may be out of order but correct). else correct
    }

    public String toString(){

    }

}

Checkbox extends Question{

    Checkbox(String question, String[] options, String[] correctAnswer){

    }

}

MultipleChoice extends Question{

    MultipleChoice(String question, String[] options, String correctAnswer){
        super(question, options, new String[]{correctAnswer});
    }
}

TrueOrFalse extends MultipleChoice{

    private Static String[] onlyOptions = new String[]{"True", "False"};

    TrueOrFalse(String question, String correctAnswer){
        //check if correctAnswer is either true or false, otherwise default correctAnswer to false
        super(question, onlyOptions, correctAnswer);
    }
}
